## Description
For a 30 x 20 grid, generate random obstacles to form a graph/maze. The starting point is always (0, 0) and the player can set the goal anywhere on the grid. The player then can choose between BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy, and A* algorithm to see the path that is generated using the selected algorithm. Player can also enable/disable weight to add more details to the graph. By clicking on different algorithms the player is able to see how each algorithm works and which algorithm performs best in the given situation.

## Block colors
Orange block: obstacle<br />
Green block: visited nodes<br />
Gray block: ready for visit 

## Control
r: generate random maze with weight<br />
n: generate random maze without weight<br />
w: weight of current path<br />
d: dept first search<br />
b: breath first search<br />
u: uniform cost search<br />
g: greedy search<br />
a: a* search<br />
left click: set goal
